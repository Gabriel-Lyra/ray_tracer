To run this you need to download golang at: https://go.dev/dl/

Now you'll likely need to download the golang/geo/r3 library. To do this open your terminal
and type "go mod init github.com/golang/geo/r3".

Finally, to run the code use your terminal to go to whatever directory your code is in
(mine is "C:\Users\gabri\Desktop\ray tracer golang", for example) and type "go run main.go"
